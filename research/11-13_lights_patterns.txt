Bytes 11-13 in the feature report appear to control the light patterns, e.g. breathing, blinking, etc.
This file has my resarch into the specifics of those three bytes

00 00 00: Disables all lights
00 xx 00: User defined solid lights

If byte 12 controls colours, byte 11's effect is overridden

Byte 11 appears to control the basic colour pattern, however is very limited in options:
00    : User defined colour
01    : Rainbow cycle
02-ff : Blue

Byte 12 appears to be more fine-grained pattern control:
00    : Off
01    : Solid
02    : Blink
03    : Breathing
04    : Unknown, appears to freeze current pattern to it's present state?
05    : Unknown colour cycle, affected by user colours
06-ff : Orange-red colour cycle, could be AIMO-related as this is what I recall the mouse defaulting to on Linux before the firmware supported storing lighting data on-device, and if I recall correctly it defaults to AIMO on Windows.

Byte 13 seems to control the speed of the pattern set by byte 13
